    "\n",
    "Our model, trained on seasons from 2004–2024, was tested on earlier years to evaluate how well it could generalize to unseen eras. When applied to the 1991–1998 seasons — all won by the Chicago Bulls — the model showed excellent performance: it ranked the Bulls **#1 in four out of six years**, and **#2 in the other two**. That level of consistency across different basketball eras gives us strong confidence in the model's ability to assess team strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking ahead, we recognize that some features like **net rating (NRtg)** or **simple rating system (SRS)** may deserve different weighting or scaling. While historically strong, their raw values may not fully capture playoff readiness or roster context. Additionally, while using only post-2004 data kept things consistent (modern pace, 3-point era, etc.), incorporating older seasons with care might further improve the model — as long as we adjust for playstyle shifts.\n",
